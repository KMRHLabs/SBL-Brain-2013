The SBL Brain 2013 hardware and software design are "open source" projects, limitted only by a few 3rd party proprietary elements. In order to build the software, you will need to obtain some libraries that are not open source such as MicroChip's USB libraries. At the time of development, all 3rd party libraries and hardware have no licencing fee or royalty requirements. We are working towards a completely and truely open source project.
